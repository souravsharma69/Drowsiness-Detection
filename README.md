Overview

This project is designed to detect drowsiness in individuals using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It processes real-time video feeds to identify signs of drowsiness and provides alerts to prevent accidents.
The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify eye states. However, due to file size constraints, the eyes.keras model is not included in this repository. You can download the model separately and place it in the project directory.
